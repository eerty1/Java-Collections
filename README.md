# Java-collections

Here I'm already savvy a bit, but still an amateur. 		:monocle_face:

Here I'm trying hard to defeat collections. :guard:

What's funny, that such an easy thing has two mutually exclusive features.

On the one hand, this module has no tricky peculiarities, you're just to remember the types and methods.

**BUT!!!** on the other hand this **SWARM** of  the subspecies, which can be distinguished by one measly feature frustrates and confuses. :honeybee:

To cut the long story short, this repository is dedicated to my struggle with collections. :man_firefighter:

As in Java-fundamentals, all the requirements for optional tasks are provided EPAM repository (the link is in the document below). :eye:

The number after "Optional Task" indicates the task number from the backup

## Requirements of the main task

* Each class should have a meaningful name and informative composition.

* Use OOP features: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.

* Inheritance should be applied when it makes sense.

* When coding, java code convention conventions should be used.

* Classes should be properly decomposed into packages.

* The console menu should be minimal.

* Files can be used to store initialization parameters.

======================================================================

**Chef**:

* Define the hierarchy of vegetables.

* Make a salad. 

* Find the calorie content. 

* Sort vegetables for the salad based on one of the parameters.

* Find vegetables in the salad that correspond to a given range of calories.

There're the steps to unpack my project: 

* git clone Java-collections

* Open it via your IDE

## Usage

There're no any peculiarities.

As I said before, just open it in your IDE and build the project.

Don't forget to change the paths to the **input/output** files
